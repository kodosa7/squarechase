# squarechase
my first javascript program (and by accident it's a game) that uses p5.js library

## run
- if you have own HTTPS server, unzip the repo and copy it there.
- for local use, install a HTTPS local server like XAMPP ```https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html```
- unzip the repo to the ```/xampp/htdocs/``` directory, e.g. ```/xampp/htdocs/squarechase/```
- navigate to ```http://127.0.0.1/[name of the repo directory]/```
- play
- at game over, refresh the website

## requirements
- ff or chrome
- internet connection (needed for font and p5.js libs)
- mouse, touchpad, trackball... ;)
